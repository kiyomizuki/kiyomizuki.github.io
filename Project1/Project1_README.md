My project is meant to recreate a beloved childhood stuffed animal in p5.js. This stuffed animal was a pink rabbit that was given to me as a young child after the original rabbit (a white one of the same brand/type) was lost and probably destroyed. The rabbit was something I slept with as a child and loved so much that it’s almost in taters at certain parts now. I loved and still do love that rabbit. She is a pink rabbit and she comforted me through years of bad times when I felt alone and like no one understood me.

This project intended to invoke a sense of nostalgia. I wanted the style to be simplistic with flat colors, and the image of the toy I had. It is not shaded for this reason. I want the viewer to think back to their childhood stuffed animal or favorite toy if they have one that they remember. That is the goal of the piece.

I think that my piece succeeds in being aesthetically pleasing. I made the rabbit look cute, utilizing the simple design and big eyes to make an “adorable” rendition of a raggedy and less cute stuffed animal (she was cute at one point but now looks worn). There were many difficulties with this assignment because p5.js was confusing for me and challenged my current understanding of code and my memory issues. I struggled to get things to appear the way I wanted them to and ended up with a few shapes (made with vertexes) inside out for a while before I was satisfied with how they looked.

It was a learning experience for me as I thought I would be able to do more for the project but overall I am satisfied with how it turned out. I am proud of what I accomplished. I like how it looks. I feel that I learned a lot of (basic) things about p5.js and I am excited to learn more about what can be done in the program going forward with CT20.</p>
